Unit 20 - "Looks like we've made our first contract!" homework

The AssociateProfitSplitter contract has been created in order to be able to pay employees quickly and effortleesly. 

It has been created so that their addreess are not hardcoded, and can be entered externally of the code. 

This will accept ether into the contract, and divide it evenly among associate-level employees.

The employee adress used can be seen on the ganache screenshot "ganache_address". The address used for each employee conincide with their number i.e one:1, two:2 and three:3.

Once the addess has been put in, we can transact with using no vaslue. Then the contact is right and we can start depositing. 

In the screenshot "deploy_and_run", it shows the addresses entered, the value of 2000000000000000000 wei (2 ether) to be spilit evenly amonst the employees.

In the screenshot depositing, we can see the gas fees, and the total amount that will be getting deposited. 

In the screenshot "confirmation_of_deposits" it shows the three addresses have gone up whilst the metamask address used has gone down.
